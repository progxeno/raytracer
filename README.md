# Ray Tracer App

This is a Swift implementation of a Ray Tracer based on Pete Shirley's Ray Tracing in One Weekend book series.

## Overview

The Ray Tracer app allows you to generate realistic images by simulating the behavior of light in a scene. It uses the principles of ray tracing to calculate the color of pixels in the image based on the interaction of rays with objects in the scene.

## Features

- Rendering of spheres, planes, and other primitive shapes
- Support for Lambertian, metal, and dielectric materials
- Soft shadows and reflections
- Antialiasing for smoother images
- Multithreading for faster rendering
- Adjustable camera parameters (position, field of view, aspect ratio)
- Configurable scene settings (light sources, object positions, materials)

## Requirements

- Swift 5.0 or later
- macOS or iOS development environment

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ray-tracer-app.git
