# Naming Convention for File Names

The naming of files follows a consistent pattern:

> resolution_samplesPerPixel_depth.jpg

For some files, the required generation time is also included at the end:

> resolution_samplesPerPixel_depth_timeInSeconds.jpg

## Explanation

- Resolution
  
    Refers to the image resolution or dimensions, typically represented as width x height.

- SamplesPerPixel
  
   Indicates the number of samples taken per pixel for rendering or image processing.

- Depth
  
   Represents the color depth or bit depth of the image.

## Examples

- 1920x1080_1024_5
- 2160x2160_1024_50_10 (generating this image took 10 seconds)
